			<h2>Subtheme: Speculation</h2>

			<h3>Overall Analysis Questions</h3>
			<ol>
				<li> Q1 Profit Analysis from Flipping: How much profit are investors typically making from flipping houses in Boston?</li>
				I am curious about this question as motivation for why speculation occurs. By getting intuition for the profit margins
				of these sales, I think I will be able to better contextualize the motivation of those who flip properties.
				<li>Corporate Ownership Impact: What proportion of Boston's residential properties are owned by large corporations, and how has this trend evolved from 2000 to 2023? </li>
				This question gets at the heart of how prevalent this problem is, and also allows me to understand how the trends have evolved over time, providing a dynamic picture of the problem.
				<li>How has corporate ownership influenced demographic changes in terms of age and racial composition</li>
				I am very interested in understanding gentrification, and this dataset presents a good opportunity to investigate it.

					I first narrowed down properties in the Boston Residential Sales data to include only flipped properties. To get intuition for the trajectory of property prices, I chose 25 random properties that were identified as being flipped in the dataset. I then plotted the date of each of the sells of the property compared with its price to track the evolution.

				<figcaption>
				The next natural question is how long properties are held before they are flipped. My original intuition on flipping thought this would be on the scale of months, but it seems to most often be 1-2 years before a property is fully flipped. I suspect some data contamination, because there is a sharp drop off after 2 years, implying that perhaps some properties were cut off. I did not investigate this further.

				Next, I wanted to understand how the prices of flipped homes compared to general homes in the dataset. There were some extreme outliers in the dataset, so I used the interquartile range method to remove outliers. As I expected, flipped properties are generally more expensive, which aligns with my intuition that these are luxury properties being flipped.

				I was curious who was flipping these properties, and it seems that LLCs win the plurality. However, no group flips a majority of properties. I suspect we lack good data for this as well.

				Finally, I felt that I had a good understanding of the dataset and was ready to answer the target question: how much are people making on flipping houses. Surprisingly, a signficant portion of flips result in losses.

			<h3>Q2</h3>
			<figure>
				<img src="figs/q2/owner_occupancy_2024.png" alt="" style="width: 80%; height: auto;">
				<figcaption>
				I first looked at the fraction of owner-occupied houses in various Boston neighborhoods, plotted with their approximate latitute/longitude to mimic a map. Very interesting that the further we get from city center, the more houses are occupied by their owners. Also fascinating that neighborhoods near city center have fewer than half their houses occupied by their owners.

			<figure>
				<img src="figs/q2/corporate_ownership_2024.png" alt="" style="width: 80%; height: auto;">
				<figcaption>
				Similar to the owner-occupied study, I looked at the fraction of corporate-owned properties in various Boston neighborhoods. There seems to be an inverse correlation between being corporate owned and the owner-occupied rates.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>


			<figure>
				<img src="figs/q2/corr_owner_company.png" alt="" style="width: 80%; height: auto;">
				<figcaption>
				Drawing from the intuition of the previous two graphs, I found that there is a strong inverse relationship between corporate ownership and owner-occupation, which we would intuitvely expect.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<figure>
				<img src="figs/q2/neighborhood_trends.png" alt="" style="width: 80%; height: auto;">
				<figcaption>
				Now I felt prepared to answer my question. Because we have another axis to visualize (time), I chose to look at line plots for both metrics across years for 6 randomly selected neighborhoods. We see that corporate ownership seems to be going up, while owner-occupied housing is going down. This could have been presented better, but I struggled to think of a way to visualize the time.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<figure>
				<img src="figs/q2/neighborhood_trends_avg.png" alt="" style="width: 80%; height: auto;">
				<figcaption>
				Looking at the average behavior across neighborhoods, we see a confirmation of the trends we observed for individual neighborhoods. Owner-occupied housing goes down, while corporate owned housing goes up with time. Shading is one standard deviation.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<figure>
				<img src="figs/q3/piechart_change.png" alt="" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
				<figcaption>
				I first wanted to see how racial demographics in areas that have been increasingly owned by corporations changed over time. However, I ended up discovering that the racial data was not updated year by year. Thus, I could do no temporal analysis of how racial dynamics have changed in gentrified areas.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<figure>
				<img src="figs/q3/piechart_comparison.png" alt="" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
				<figcaption>
				Next, I compared the racial dynamics in 2024 between a strongly corporate owned area and one that is not corporate owned. We see a very significant picture painted, where the South Boston Waterfront has more than three times the relative white population of Hyde Park. A note of caution is that I assumed that since the census racial data does not change year-by-year, the data is just for 2024. This is not necessarily true, and I think a more careful approach would be to not use this data at all if I think it's corrupted but don't know how it's corrupted. Unfortunately, because we have scarce data I made an assumption.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<figure>
				<img src="figs/q3/piechart_age.png" alt="" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
				<figcaption>
				Next, I wanted to understand the relative age demographics of gentrified and non gentrified areas. We see that the more gentrified areas seem to have an older population than less gentrified areas.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<figure>
				<img src="figs/q3/demographics_scatter.png" alt="" style="width: 80%; height: auto;">
				<figcaption>
				Formalizing the intuitions from the last two graphs, I felt ready to answer the question. Here, I see that areas that are owned by corporations are typically white and have older populations. Unfortunately, without access to temporal data I was unable to understand how this changed over time or get more clarity about if this trend is causal or purely correlational. Even if it is causal, it is unclear whether corporations owning property make areas more white, or if pre-existing white areas are targeted by corporations.

			<h2>Summary</h2>
			<p>In this exploratory data analysis, we investigated the implications of property flipping and corporate ownership on Boston's residential housing market from 2000 to 2023. Key findings include:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>Flipping Properties</strong>: Investors generally hold properties for 1-2 years before flipping, with some transactions resulting in financial losses. Flipped properties are typically more expensive, suggesting they are often luxury properties.</li>
				<li><strong>Corporate Ownership</strong>: An increasing trend in corporate ownership correlates inversely with the rate of owner-occupied residences. This shift is particularly noticeable in neighborhoods closer to the city center, where corporate ownership rates are higher and owner-occupancy rates are lower.</li>
				<li><strong>Demographic Impact</strong>: Areas with higher corporate ownership tend to have older and predominantly white populations. However, due to the lack of updated racial data over time, it was challenging to establish if the demographic shifts are directly caused by corporate ownership or if these areas were already appealing to corporations for their existing demographic profiles.</li>
